We are living in the era of Smart cities where everything is planned and systematic. The problem we are facing is of the population, which is rising rapidly. In recent years, urban migration has skyrocketed. This has resulted in the rise of garbage waste everywhere. Dumping of garbage in public places creates a polluted environment in the neighborhood. It could cause a number of serious diseases to the people living around. This will embarrass the evaluation of the affected area. In order to reduce waste and maintain good hygiene, we need a systematic approach to tackle the problem. The traditional way of manually monitoring the wastes in waste bins is a complex, cumbersome process and utilizes more human effort, time and cost which is not compatible with the present day technologies in any way. We propose a solution to this waste problem which manages the garbage waste smartly. This research paper proposes an IoT based smart system based on clean waste management that assesses the level of waste on dustbins through sensory systems. In this system the microcontroller is used as a visual connector connecting sensor and the IoT system. This an advanced method in which waste management is automated. This project IoT Garbage Monitoring system is a very innovative system which will help to keep the cities clean. This system monitors the garbage bins and informs about the level of garbage collected in the garbage bins via a web page. This web page also send all information to garbage collection vehicles.

Ulteasonic Sensor

An ultrasonic sensor is an electronic device that measures the distance of a target object by emitting ultrasonic sound waves, and converts the reflected sound into an electrical signal. Ultrasonic waves travel faster than the speed of audible sound (i.e. the sound that humans can hear). Ultrasonic sensors have two main components: the transmitter (which emits the sound using piezoelectric crystals) and the receiver (which encounters the sound after it has travelled to and from the target).
In order to calculate the distance between the sensor and the object, the sensor measures the time it takes between the emission of the sound by the transmitter to its contact with the receiver. The formula for this calculation is D = ½ T x C (where D is the distance, T is the time, and C is the speed of sound ~ 343 meters/second).

Arduino UNO R3

Arduino UNO is a microcontroller board based on the ATmega328P. It has 14 digital input/output pins (of which 6 can be used as PWM outputs), 6 analog inputs, a 16 MHz ceramic resonator, a USB connection, a power jack, an ICSP header and a reset button. It contains everything needed to support the microcontroller; simply connect it to a computer with a USB cable or power it with a AC-to-DC adapter or battery to get started.


GPS Module

These GPS modules are compatible with Arduino and Raspberry Pi, making it easy for you to start to try out.The Air 530 Module in Grove - GPS(Air530) is a high performance, highly integrated multi-mode statelite positioning and navigation module. It supports GPS / Beidou / Glonass / Galileo / QZSS / SBAS, which makes it suitable for GNSS positioning applications such as car navigation, smart wear and drone. And Air530 module is also supporting NMEA 0183 V4.1 protocol and compatible with previous versions. Meanwhile, the E-1612-UB module series of Grove - GPS Module is a family of stand-alone GPS receivers featuring the high performance u-blox 5 positioning engine. The 50-channel u-blox 5 positioning engine boasts a Time-To-First-Fix ( TTFF ) of under 1 second. The dedicated acquisition engine, with over 1 million correlators, is capable of massive parallel time / frequency space searches, enabling it to find satellites instantly.

GSM/GPRS Module

- What is GSM?
GSM (Global System for Mobile Communications, originally Groupe Spécial Mobile), is a standard developed by the European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI). It was created to describe the protocols for second-generation (2G) digital cellular networks used by mobile phones and is now the default global standard for mobile communications – with over 90% market share, operating in over 219 countries and territories.
- What is GPRS?
General Packet Radio Service (GPRS) is a packet-oriented mobile data service on the 2G and 3G cellular communication system’s global system for mobile communications (GSM). GPRS was originally standardized by European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI) in response to the earlier CDPD and i-mode packet-switched cellular technologies. It is now maintained by the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP).

Buzzer

A buzzer or beeper is an audio signaling device, which may be mechanical, electromechanical, or piezoelectric (piezo for short). Typical uses of buzzers and beepers include alarm devices, timers, train and confirmation of user input such as a mouse click or keystroke.


Connecting Wires

A connecting wire allows travels the electric current from one point to another point without resistivity. Resistance of connecting wire should always be near zero. Copper wires have low resistance and are therefore suitable for low resistance.


NodeMCU(Node MicroController Unit)

image


NodeMCU is an open source firmware for which open source prototyping board designs are available. The name "NodeMCU" combines "node" and "MCU" (micro-controller unit). Strictly speaking, the term "NodeMCU" refers to the firmware rather than the associated development kits. NodeMCU was created shortly after the ESP8266 came out. On December 30, 2013, Espressif Systems began production of the ESP8266.NodeMCU started on 13 Oct 2014, when Hong committed the first file of nodemcu-firmware to GitHub.Two months later, the project expanded to include an open-hardware platform when developer Huang R committed the gerber file of an ESP8266 board, named devkit v0.9.


16x2 LCD

The Liquid Crystal library allows you to control LCD displays that are compatible with the Hitachi HD44780 driver. There are many of them out there, and you can usually tell them by the 16-pin interface. The LCDs have a parallel interface, meaning that the microcontroller has to manipulate several interface pins at once to control the display.
